PROTOTYPE - CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN

INTENT

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create
new objects by copying this prototype.

MOTIVATION

You could build an editor for music scores by customizing a general framework
for graphical editors and adding new objects that represent notes, rests, and
staves. The editor framework may have a palette of tools for adding these music
objects to the score. The palette would also include tools for selecting, moving,
and otherwise manipulating music objects. Users will click on the quarter-note
tool and use it to add quarter notes to the score. Or they can use the move tool
to move a note up or down on the staff, thereby changing its pitch.

Let's assume the framework provides an abstract Graphic class for graphical
components, like notes and staves. Moreover, it'll provide an abstract Tool class
for defining tools like those in the palette. The framework also predefines a
GraphicTool subclass for tools that create instances of graphical objects and
add them to the document.

But GraphicTool presents a problem to the framework designer. The classes for
notes and staves are specific to our application, but the GraphicTool class belongs
to the framework. GraphicTool doesn't know how to create instances of our music
classes to add to the score. We could subclass GraphicTool for each kind of music
object, but that would produce lots of subclasses that differ only in the kind
of music object they instantiate. We know object composition is a flexible
alternative to subclassing. The question is, how can the framework use it to
parameterize instances of GraphicTool by the class of Graphic they're supposed
to create?

The solution lies in making GraphicTool create a new Graphic by copying or "cloning"
an instance of a Graphic subclass. We call this instance a prototype. GraphicTool
is parameterized by the prototype it should clone and add to the document. If
all Graphic subclasses support a Clone operation, then the GraphicTool can clone
any kind of Graphic.

So in our music editor, each tool for creating a music object is an instance of
GraphicTool that's initialized with a different prototype. Each GraphicTool
instance will produce a music object by cloning its prototype and adding the clone
to the score.

We can use the Prototype pattern to reduce the number of classes even further.
We have separate classes for whole notes and half notes, but that's probably
unnecessary. Instead they could be instances of the same class initialized with
different bitmaps and durations. A tool for creating whole notes becomes just
a GraphicTool whose prototype is a MusicalNote initialized to be a whole note.
This can reduce the number of classes in the system dramatically. It also makes
it easier to add a new kind of note to the music editor.

APPLICABILITY

Use the Prototype pattern when a system should be independent of how its products
are created, composed, and represented; and

· when the classes to instantiate are specified at run-time, for example,
by dynamic loading; or

· to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class
hierarchy of products; or

· when instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations
of state. It may be more convenient to install a corresponding number of
prototypes and clone them rather than instantiating the class manually,
each time with the appropriate state.

STRUCTURE

PARTICIPANTS

· Prototype (Graphic)
o declares an interface for cloning itself.

· ConcretePrototype (Staff, WholeNote, HalfNote)
o implements an operation for cloning itself.

· Client (GraphicTool)
o creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself.

COLLABORATIONS

· A client asks a prototype to clone itself.

CONSEQUENCES

Prototype has many of the same consequences that Abstract Factory (99) and Builder
(110) have: It hides the concrete product classes from the client, thereby reducing
the number of names clients know about. Moreover, these patterns let a client
work with application-specific classes without modification.
Additional benefits of the Prototype pattern are listed below.

1. Adding and removing products at run-time. Prototypes let you incorporate
a new concrete product class into a system simply by registering a
prototypical instance with the client. That's a bit more flexible than other
creational patterns, because a client can install and remove prototypes
at run-time.

2. Specifying new objects by varying values. Highly dynamic systems let you
define new behavior through object composition—by specifying values for
an object's variables, for example—and not by defining new classes. You
effectively define new kinds of objects by instantiating existing classes
and registering the instances as prototypes of client objects. A client
can exhibit new behavior by delegating responsibility to the prototype.
This kind of design lets users define new "classes" without programming.
In fact, cloning a prototype is similar to instantiating a class. The
Prototype pattern can greatly reduce the number of classes a system needs.
In our music editor, one GraphicTool class can create a limitless variety
of music objects.

3. Specifying new objects by varying structure. Many applications build
objects from parts and subparts. Editors for circuit design, for example,
build circuits out of subcircuits.1 For convenience, such applications
often let you instantiate complex, user-defined structures, say, to use
a specific subcircuit again and again.
The Prototype pattern supports this as well. We simply add this subcircuit
as a prototype to the palette of available circuit elements. As long as
the composite circuit object implements Clone as a deep copy, circuits with
different structures can be prototypes.

4. Reduced subclassing. Factory Method (121) often produces a hierarchy of
Creator classes that parallels the product class hierarchy. The Prototype
pattern lets you clone a prototype instead of asking a factory method to
make a new object. Hence you don't need a Creator class hierarchy at all.
This benefit applies primarily to languages like C++ that don't treat
classes as first-class objects. Languages that do, like Smalltalk and
Objective C, derive less benefit, since you can always use a class object
as a creator. Class objects already act like prototypes in these languages.

5. Configuring an application with classes dynamically. Some run-time
environments let you load classes into an application dynamically. The
Prototype pattern is the key to exploiting such facilities in a language
like C++.
An application that wants to create instances of a dynamically loaded class
won't be able to reference its constructor statically. Instead, the run-time
environment creates an instance of each class automatically when it's loaded,
and it registers the instance with a prototype manager (see the
Implementation section). Then the application can ask the prototype manager
for instances of newly loaded classes, classes that weren't linked with
the program originally. The ET++ application framework [WGM88] has a
run-time system that uses this scheme.
The main liability of the Prototype pattern is that each subclass of Prototype
must implement the Clone operation, which may be difficult. For example, adding
Clone is difficult when the classes under consideration already exist.
Implementing Clone can be difficult when their internals include objects that
don't support copying or have circular references.

IMPLEMENTATION

Prototype is particularly useful with static languages like C++, where classes
are not objects, and little or no type information is available at run-time. It's
less important in languages like Smalltalk or Objective C that provide what amounts
to a prototype (i.e., a class object) for creating instances of each class. This
pattern is built into prototype-based languages like Self [US87], in which all
object creation happens by cloning a prototype.

Consider the following issues when implementing prototypes:
1. Using a prototype manager. When the number of prototypes in a system isn't
fixed (that is, they can be created and destroyed dynamically), keep a
registry of available prototypes. Clients won't manage prototypes
themselves but will store and retrieve them from the registry. A client
will ask the registry for a prototype before cloning it. We call this
registry a prototype manager.
A prototype manager is an associative store that returns the prototype
matching a given key. It has operations for registering a prototype under
a key and for unregistering it. Clients can change or even browse through
the registry at run-time. This lets clients extend and take inventory on
the system without writing code.

2. Implementing the Clone operation. The hardest part of the Prototype pattern
is implementing the Clone operation correctly. It's particularly tricky
when object structures contain circular references.
Most languages provide some support for cloning objects. For example,
Smalltalk provides an implementation of copy that's inherited by all
subclasses of Object. C++ provides a copy constructor. But these facilities
don't solve the "shallow copy versus deep copy" problem [GR83]. That is,
does cloning an object in turn clone its instance variables, or do the clone
and original just share the variables?
A shallow copy is simple and often sufficient, and that's what Smalltalk
provides by default. The default copy constructor in C++ does a member-wise
copy, which means pointers will be shared between the copy and the original.
But cloning prototypes with complex structures usually requires a deep copy,
because the clone and the original must be independent. Therefore you must
ensure that the clone's components are clones of the prototype's components.
Cloning forces you to decide what if anything will be shared.
If objects in the system provide Save and Load operations, then you can
use them to provide a default implementation of Clone simply by saving the
object and loading it back immediately. The Save operation saves the object
into a memory buffer, and Load creates a duplicate by reconstructing the
object from the buffer.

3. Initializing clones. While some clients are perfectly happy with the clone
as is, others will want to initialize some or all of its internal state
to values of their choosing. You generally can't pass these values in the
Clone operation, because their number will vary between classes of
prototypes. Some prototypes might need multiple initialization parameters;
others won't need any. Passing parameters in the Clone operation precludes
a uniform cloning interface.
It might be the case that your prototype classes already define operations
for (re)setting key pieces of state. If so, clients may use these operations
immediately after cloning. If not, then you may have to introduce an
Initialize operation (see the Sample Code section) that takes
initialization parameters as arguments and sets the clone's internal state
accordingly. Beware of deep-copying Clone operations—the copies may have
to be deleted (either explicitly or within Initialize) before you
reinitialize them.

KNOWN USES

Perhaps the first example of the Prototype pattern was in Ivan Sutherland's
Sketchpad system [Sut63]. The first widely known application of the pattern in
an object-oriented language was in ThingLab, where users could form a composite
object and then promote it to a prototype by installing it in a library of reusable
objects [Bor81]. Goldberg and Robson mention prototypes as a pattern [GR83], but
Coplien [Cop92] gives a much more complete description. He describes idioms related
to the Prototype pattern for C++ and gives many examples and variations.
Etgdb is a debugger front-end based on ET++ that provides a point-and-click
interface to different line-oriented debuggers. Each debugger has a corresponding
DebuggerAdaptor subclass. For example, GdbAdaptor adapts etgdb to the command
syntax of GNU gdb, while SunDbxAdaptor adapts etgdb to Sun's dbx debugger. Etgdb
does not have a set of DebuggerAdaptor classes hard-coded into it. Instead, it
reads the name of the adaptor to use from an environment variable, looks for a
prototype with the specified name in a global table, and then clones the prototype.
New debuggers can be added to etgdb by linking it with the DebuggerAdaptor that
works for that debugger.
The "interaction technique library" in Mode Composer stores prototypes of objects
that support various interaction techniques [Sha90]. Any interaction technique
created by the Mode Composer can be used as a prototype by placing it in this
library. The Prototype pattern lets Mode Composer support an unlimited set of
interaction techniques.
The music editor example discussed earlier is based on the Unidraw drawing
framework [VL90].

RELATED PATTERNS

Prototype and Abstract Factory are competing patterns in some ways, as we
discuss at the end of this chapter. They can also be used together, however. An
Abstract Factory might store a set of prototypes from which to clone and return
product objects.
Designs that make heavy use of the Composite and Decorator patterns
often can benefit from Prototype as well.
