BRIDGE - STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN

INTENT

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary 
independently. 


ALSO KNOWN AS
Handle/Body

MOTIVATION

When an abstraction can have one of several possible implementations, the usual 
way to accommodate them is to use inheritance. An abstract class defines the 
interface to the abstraction, and concrete subclasses implement it in different 
ways. But this approach isn't always flexible enough. Inheritance binds an 
implementation to the abstraction permanently, which makes it difficult to modify, 
extend, and reuse abstractions and implementations independently. 
Consider the implementation of a portable Window abstraction in a user interface 
toolkit. This abstraction should enable us to write applications that work on 
both the X Window System and IBM's Presentation Manager (PM), for example. Using 
inheritance, we could define an abstract class Window and subclasses XWindow and 
PMWindow that implement the Window interface for the different platforms. But 
this approach has two drawbacks: 

1. It's inconvenient to extend the Window abstraction to cover different kinds 
of windows or new platforms. Imagine an IconWindow subclass of Window that 
specializes the Window abstraction for icons. To support IconWindows for 
both platforms, we have to implement two new classes, XIconWindow and 
PMIconWindow. Worse, we'll have to define two classes for every kind of 
window. Supporting a third platform requires yet another new Window subclass 
for every kind of window.

2. It makes client code platform-dependent. Whenever a client creates a window, 
it instantiates a concrete class that has a specific implementation. For 
example, creating an XWindow object binds the Window abstraction to the 
X Window implementation, which makes the client code dependent on the X 
Window implementation. This, in turn, makes it harder to port the client 
code to other platforms. 
Clients should be able to create a window without committing to a concrete 
implementation. Only the window implementation should depend on the 
platform on which the application runs. Therefore client code should 
instantiate windows without mentioning specific platforms. 
The Bridge pattern addresses these problems by putting the Window abstraction 
and its implementation in separate class hierarchies. There is one class hierarchy 
for window interfaces (Window, IconWindow, TransientWindow) and a separate 
hierarchy for platform-specific window implementations, with WindowImp as its 
root. The XWindowImp subclass, for example, provides an implementation based on 
the X Window System.

All operations on Window subclasses are implemented in terms of abstract operations 
from the WindowImp interface. This decouples the window abstractions from the 
various platform-specific implementations. We refer to the relationship between 
Window and WindowImp as a bridge, because it bridges the abstraction and its 
implementation, letting them vary independently. 

APPLICABILITY

Use the Bridge pattern when 
· you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its 
implementation. This might be the case, for example, when the implementation 
must be selected or switched at run-time. 
· both the abstractions and their implementations should be extensible by 
subclassing. In this case, the Bridge pattern lets you combine the different 
abstractions and implementations and extend them independently. 
· changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on 
clients; that is, their code should not have to be recompiled. 
· (C++) you want to hide the implementation of an abstraction completely from 
clients. In C++ the representation of a class is visible in the class 
interface. 
· you have a proliferation of classes as shown earlier in the first Motivation 
diagram. Such a class hierarchy indicates the need for splitting an object
into two parts. Rumbaugh uses the term "nested generalizations" [RBP+91] 
to refer to such class hierarchies. 
· you want to share an implementation among multiple objects (perhaps using 
reference counting), and this fact should be hidden from the client. A simple 
example is Coplien's String class [Cop92], in which multiple objects can 
share the same string representation (StringRep).

STRUCTURE

PARTICPANTS

· Abstraction (Window) 
o defines the abstraction's interface. 
o maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor. 

· RefinedAbstraction (IconWindow) 
o Extends the interface defined by Abstraction. 

· Implementor (WindowImp) 
o defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface 
doesn't have to correspond exactly to Abstraction's interface; in 
fact the two interfaces can be quite different. Typically the 
Implementor interface provides only primitive operations, and 
Abstraction defines higher-level operations based on these 
primitives. 

· ConcreteImplementor (XWindowImp, PMWindowImp) 
o implements the Implementor interface and defines its concrete 
implementation.

COLLABORATIONS

· Abstraction forwards client requests to its Implementor object.

CONSEQUENCES

The Bridge pattern has the following consequences: 

1. Decoupling interface and implementation. An implementation is not bound 
permanently to an interface. The implementation of an abstraction can be 
configured at run-time. It's even possible for an object to change its 
implementation at run-time. 
Decoupling Abstraction and Implementor also eliminates compile-time 
dependencies on the implementation. Changing an implementation class 
doesn't require recompiling the Abstraction class and its clients. This 
property is essential when you must ensure binary compatibility between 
different versions of a class library. 
Furthermore, this decoupling encourages layering that can lead to a 
better-structured system. The high-level part of a system only has to know 
about Abstraction and Implementor. 

2. Improved extensibility. You can extend the Abstraction and Implementor 
hierarchies independently. 

3. Hiding implementation details from clients. You can shield clients from 
implementation details, like the sharing of implementor objects and the 
accompanying reference count mechanism (if any).

IMPLEMENTATION
Consider the following implementation issues when applying the Bridge pattern: 
1. Only one Implementor. In situations where there's only one implementation, 
creating an abstract Implementor class isn't necessary. This is a degenerate 
case of the Bridge pattern; there's a one-to-one relationship between 
Abstraction and Implementor. Nevertheless, this separation is still useful 
when a change in the implementation of a class must not affect its existing 
clients—that is, they shouldn't have to be recompiled, just relinked. 
Carolan [Car89] uses the term "Cheshire Cat" to describe this separation. 
In C++, the class interface of the Implementor class can be defined in a 
private header file that isn't provided to clients. This lets you hide an 
implementation of a class completely from its clients. 

2. Creating the right Implementor object. How, when, and where do you decide 
which Implementor class to instantiate when there's more than one? 
If Abstraction knows about all ConcreteImplementor classes, then it can 
instantiate one of them in its constructor; it can decide between them based 
on parameters passed to its constructor. If, for example, a collection class 
supports multiple implementations, the decision can be based on the size 
of the collection. A linked list implementation can be used for small 
collections and a hash table for larger ones. 
Another approach is to choose a default implementation initially and change 
it later according to usage. For example, if the collection grows bigger 
than a certain threshold, then it switches its implementation to one that's 
more appropriate for a large number of items. 
It's also possible to delegate the decision to another object altogether. 
In the Window/WindowImp example, we can introduce a factory object (see 
Abstract Factory (99)) whose sole duty is to encapsulate platform-specifics. 
The factory knows what kind of WindowImp object to create for the platform 
in use; a Window simply asks it for a WindowImp, and it returns the right 
kind. A benefit of this approach is that Abstraction is not coupled directly 
to any of the Implementor classes. 

3. Sharing implementors. Coplien illustrates how the Handle/Body idiom in C++ 
can be used to share implementations among several objects [Cop92]. The 
Body stores a reference count that the Handle class increments and 
decrements.

4. Using multiple inheritance. You can use multiple inheritance in C++ to 
combine an interface with its implementation [Mar91]. For example, a class 
can inherit publicly from Abstraction and privately from a 
ConcreteImplementor. But because this approach relies on static 
inheritance, it binds an implementation permanently to its interface. 
Therefore you can't implement a true Bridge with multiple inheritance—at 
least not in C++.


KNOWN USES

The Window example above comes from ET++ [WGM88]. In ET++, WindowImp is called 
"WindowPort" and has subclasses such as XWindowPort and SunWindowPort. The Window 
object creates its corresponding Implementor object by requesting it from an 
abstract factory called "WindowSystem." WindowSystem provides an interface for 
creating platform-specific objects such as fonts, cursors, bitmaps, and so forth. 
The ET++ Window/WindowPort design extends the Bridge pattern in that the WindowPort 
also keeps a reference back to the Window. The WindowPort implementor class uses
this reference to notify Window about WindowPort-specific events: the arrival 
of input events, window resizes, etc. 
Both Coplien [Cop92] and Stroustrup [Str91] mention Handle classes and give some 
examples. Their examples emphasize memory management issues like sharing string 
representations and support for variable-sized objects. Our focus is more on 
supporting independent extension of both an abstraction and its implementation. 
libg++ [Lea88] defines classes that implement common data structures, such as 
Set, LinkedSet, HashSet, LinkedList, and HashTable. Set is an abstract class that 
defines a set abstraction, while LinkedList and HashTable are concrete 
implementors for a linked list and a hash table, respectively. LinkedSet and 
HashSet are Set implementors that bridge between Set and their concrete 
counterparts LinkedList and HashTable. This is an example of a degenerate bridge, 
because there's no abstract Implementor class. 
NeXT's AppKit [Add94] uses the Bridge pattern in the implementation and display 
of graphical images. An image can be represented in several different ways. The 
optimal display of an image depends on the properties of a display device, 
specifically its color capabilities and its resolution. Without help from AppKit, 
developers would have to determine which implementation to use under various 
circumstances in every application. 
To relieve developers of this responsibility, AppKit provides an 
NXImage/NXImageRep bridge. NXImage defines the interface for handling images. 
The implementation of images is defined in a separate NXImageRep class hierarchy 
having subclasses such as NXEPSImageRep, NXCachedImageRep, and NXBitMapImageRep. 
NXImage maintains a reference to one or more NXImageRep objects. If there is more 
than one image implementation, then NXImage selects the most appropriate one for 
the current display device. NXImage is even capable of converting one 
implementation to another if necessary. The interesting aspect of this Bridge 
variant is that NXImage can store more than one NXImageRep implementation at a 
time.

hand, is used up-front in a design to let abstractions and implementations vary 
independently.
